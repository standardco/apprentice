Forking a repository allows a user to contribute to a project by pushing to the repository and creating a pull request. By forking the Standard Code repository, I am able to push my work to back up and it can then be reviewed."
    @oneMorething = "This scavenger hunt has been both interesting and challenging. I was both excited and anxious to tackle the maps portion. I thought that it would be something that I would have some challenges with, but would ultimately be able to do in a reasonable amount of time. Come Friday, the last day for submission, I was finally able to get it completed. After getting the map and points to render, I realized that the most difficult part of this exercise was me getting over myself. A combination of fear and stubborness compelled me to go in a direction that was not the best choice. It took much more time and effort than it should have. I had to finally stop and realize that the track I was on was wrong. Wrong for many reasons, but most of all it was not what was needed for this project. I chose a path that was not getting me to the goal. I had to shift my thinking, start over a couple of times, and learn my lesson. I guess ultimately I am saying that this was so much freakin' fun! Thanks for the opportunity."
